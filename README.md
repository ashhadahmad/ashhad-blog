# Ashhad.in Blog / Website

[![View on the Web]](https://ashhad.in)

My blog written in Astro, The pages are written in .astro, and the blogs are written in markdown.

Currently a WIP.

### Todo:

1. Update the MenuIcon to use one SVG with 2 different paths - One for open and one for close instead of using 2 different SVGs.
2. Use a better photo :P for the landing page.
3. Add Work experience, Projects and Skills to the landing page
4. Show only the 3 recent posts and add a view all posts button next to it which redirects to /posts. But I don't think I want this page in the navbar.
5. Copy over the contents from current ashhad.in (Which is a Ghost blog converted HTML Site).
6. Publish it (Soon).
