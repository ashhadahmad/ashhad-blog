## Intro

If I had to learn C++ from scratch, I'd do this -

- Write "Hello World" in C++ - [Link](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/examples/print-sentence) - Read about what every line in a "Hello World" program does and why its important.
- Time and Space Complexity - [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/).
- Variables and data types - [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_variables.asp), [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-variables/) - Learn about how the variables are stored in the memory. Stack vs Heap memory. Learn about how to take inputs in variables and how to print outputs - [Link](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/input-output). Learn about the limits of variables - [Link](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/data-types). Also read about how one data type is converted into another - [Link](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/type-conversion).
- Opeators and how they interact with different data types - [Link](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/operators).
- Conditional statements - If / Else - [Link](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/if-else). And learn about relational operators - [Link](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/relational-logical-operators). Try to stack multiple If / Else statements together.

#### Questions

1.  Take 4 marks as input and print average marks - Eg - 18, 19, 19, 18 => 18.5. Make sure you print a floating number.
2.  Given the first 3 numbers and n, find the nth number of the arithmetic progression.
3.  Given a number, Write Fizz if the number is divisible by 3, Buzz if the number is divisible by 5 and FizzBuzz if it is divisble by both 3 and 5.

## Loops

- Loops - [For loop](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/for-loop), [While loop, Do while loop](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/do-while-loop). Try to write nested loops.
- Control flow statements - [Break](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/break-statement), [Continue](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/continue-statement) and [Goto](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/goto).
- [Switch statements](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/switch-case) and when to use them over If Else.

#### Questions

1.  For a given n, Return the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
2.  Create a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter
3.  Create a calculator from scratch. User can input 1,2,3,4 for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division respectively. User can then input two numbers and the program should return the necessary output.
4.  Given a number, Check if it is a palindrome.
5.  Generate the first n numbers of Fibonacci.
6.  For a given n, Print star pattern (E.g. n = 4)

```
*
**
***
****
```

7.  For a given n, Print number pattern (E.g. n = 4)

```
1
12
123
1234
```

8.  For a given n, Print alphabet pattern (E.g. n = 4)

```
A
AB
ABC
ABCD
```

9.  For a give number n, Print reverse number pattern (E.g. n = 4)

```
1234
123
12
1
```

10. For a given n, Print number pattern (E.g. n = 4, Spaces in beginning)

```
1
12
123
1234
```

11. For a given n, Print star pattern (E.g. n = 3, Spaces in beginning)

```
*
***
*****
```

12. For a given n, Print star pattern (E.g. n = 3, Spaces in beginning)

```
*
***
*****
***
*
```

13. For a given n, Print number pattern (E.g. n = 3)

```
33333
32223
32123
32223
33333
```

## Functions

- [Functions](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/function),
- [Arguments and Return Types](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/user-defined-function-types),
- What are [default arguments](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/default-argument) and how to [overload a function](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/function-overloading)
- What is [scope of a variable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scope-of-variables-in-c/) ?
- How to [call a function by value or reference](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/differences-between-pass-by-value-and-pass-by-reference-in-cplusplus) ?

#### Questions

1.  Make a Celsius to Fahrenheit function that takes a float value of Fahrenheit and returns a Celsius value. It should return the room temperature if no value is passed.

The questions for the topics below are avaialbe in DSA List

<OpenLink name="👨‍💻Ashhad DSA List" link="https://ashhad.in/list" />
